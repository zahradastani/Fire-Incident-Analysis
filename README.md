# Fire Incident Data Analysis & Citizenship Education Model

**Client:** Mashhad Municipality Fire and Safety Services Organization 
**Associated with:** Ferdowsi University of Mashhad 
**Duration:** April 2024 â€“ May 2025  
**Tools & Techniques:** R, K-Means Clustering, Expert Interviews, Survey Analysis  

## Summary  
This project focused on enhancing fire prevention education in Mashhad through data mining and contextualized instructional design. Key components included assessment of existing programs, operational data clustering, global benchmarking, and the development of a localized educational model.

## Objectives
- Analyze current safety education structures and identify gaps  
- Cluster high-risk urban areas using K-Means  
- Compare international training frameworks (e.g., NFPA, FEMA)  
- Develop a localized, modular education model  
- Design assessment tools to monitor training effectiveness  

## Key Findings
- **Gap Analysis:** Identified shortcomings in target groups, delivery methods, and equipment used in current training.  
- **Operational Data Mining:** Applied K-Means clustering on fire, accident, and prevention data to detect high-risk zones and frequent causes.  
- **Global Benchmarking:** Extracted effective strategies from FEMA, NFPA, and fire departments in NYC, London, and Australia.  
- **Localized Model:** Created a tailored framework with 28 modular worksheets covering educational needs, expected outcomes, and evaluation methods.  
- **Impact Assessment Tools:** Designed pre-/post-tests and citizen behavior checklists to measure the effectiveness of training efforts.
